## Getting Started

This project is a collection of frontend machine coding question solutions. 
The master branch contains the starter repo. 
Each branch solves the problem as suggested by the branch name.

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Checkout to a specific branch to refer the solutions.

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```

5. Problem statement

      * Fetch data from the API and show it in a tabular format with the following features:
      * The table component should have an input field above the table that lets users filter the rows based on the matching search keyword. The filtering should be case-insensitive and should work for any column value.
      * The table component should allow users to sort the data in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column headers. The sort order can be applied on any one column at a time.
      * The table component should display some visual feedback to indicate which column is sorted and in which order.
      * Display 5 records at a time and add pagination using local data.
